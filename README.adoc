// Need some preamble to get TOC:
We describe the shortest sequence of steps required to bootstrap into an infrastructure-as-code tool so that further configuration of the Google Cloud Platform organization is managed through the tool.

== Which Tool - Terraform or Pulumi? Besom!

During my research into all this, I used Terraform;
although I did stumble onto some mentions of Pulumi,
it was only after I completed the Terraform setup three times and wrote it up
that I realize that Pulumi is actually an _alternative_ to Terraform - and I like it better ;)

With Pulumi, instead of a Terraform-specific language (HCL),
I can use my preferred language (Scala)
and my preferred build tool (Gradle)
to build the description of the state I want
and update the state to the desired state.

To some extent, I agree that configuration languages
https://www.haskellforall.com/2020/01/why-dhall-advertises-absence-of-turing.html[should not be Turing complete] -
e.g., https://dhall-lang.org[Dhall];
and that build file should be https://degoes.net/articles/new-scala-build-tool[data, not program];
but having the full power of my programming language at my disposal when describing
the desired state of my cloud infrastructure feels great ;)

Later still, I found out that there exists a Scala Pulumi SDK: https://github.com/VirtusLab/besom[Besom]; although young, the project is already quite capable,
and is being actively developed by a team of very smart and friendly people.
Besom facilitates writing Pulumi code in a native Scala style and integrates with the effects systems! Using Besom SDK with Pulumi is my current choice.

(Notes on Terraform are in link:README-terraform.adoc[README-terraform])

== Google Workspace - Terraform Only

Unlike https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/googleworkspace/latest/docs[Terraform],
Pulumi does not have a Google Workspace provider, so some things can not be managed using Pulumi.

Creation and deletion of workspace users and changing their settings can not be done with Pulumi, but I do not miss this functionality.

Creation and deletion of groups and management of group membership can be done
using the GCP provider (which Pulumi, of course, does have).

Changing group settings and _aliases_ can not be done with Pulumi at this point,
and I _do_ miss this functionality.

== Consoles

There is a number of UI 'consoles' that are used to manage the configuration:

- https://domains.google.com[Google Domains]
- https://admin.google.com/[Admin Console]
- https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Console]
- https://groups.google.com/[Google Groups]
- https://search.google.com/search-console[Google Search Console]
- https://www.google.com/webmasters[Google Search Central]
- https://analytics.google.com[Google Analytics]
- https://marketingplatform.google.com[Google Marketing Platform]

Manual steps that can be done either in various UI consoles _or_ using command line
are given in the command line form.

== Command Line Tools

The tools that need to be installed:

For interacting with Google Cloud: `gcloud` (`google-cloud-cli`) from https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install[cloud.google.com/sdk].

For key management etc.: `direnv` from https://direnv.net[direnv.net].

`Pulumi` from https://www.pulumi.com/docs/install[pulumi.com].

`Besom` from https://github.com/VirtusLab/besom[Besom].

== Structure

Sample setup for Pulumi/Besom is in the link:domain-infra/besom/[domain-infra/besom] folder.

In the following and in the sample files,

- `domain.tld` is the domain of the organization involved
- `admin@domain.tld` is the super-admin of the domain

== Preparations

In https://domains.google.com[Google Domains]:

- transfer Workspace subscription from Google Domains to Google Workspace

In https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Console]:

- GCP organization gets auto-created upon login (?)
- start GCP trial if applicable
- set up billing

In https://admin.google.com/ac/apps/sites/address[Admin Console]:

- set up billing
- turn off automatic Google Workspace licensing
- activate Google Groups for Business (optional)

== Bootstrapping

Here we:

- create a project
- enable services in it
- create service account
- assign roles to it

[source, shell]
----
# log in as a super-admin
gcloud auth login admin@domain.tld

# create project
gcloud projects create "domain-infra" \
  --name="Domain Cloud Infrastructure" --no-enable-cloud-apis

# find out billing `ACCOUNT_ID` (and `NAME`)
$ gcloud beta billing accounts list

# link the project to the billing account
$ gcloud beta billing projects link "domain-infra" \
  --billing-account ACCOUNT_ID
$ gcloud config set project "domain-infra"

# enable APIs used for the infrastructure setup
$ gcloud services list --available # all
$ gcloud services list             # enabled

# "Cloud Billing API": for working with billing accounts
$ gcloud services enable cloudbilling.googleapis.com

# "Cloud Resource Manager API": for project operations
$ gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com

# "Identity and Access Management (IAM) API": for Service Account creation
# also enables iamcredentials.googleapis.com
$ gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com

# "Service Usage API": listing/enabling/disabling services
$ gcloud services enable serviceusage.googleapis.com

# create a Service Account for the infrastructure work
$ gcloud iam service-accounts create terraform \
  --display-name="terraform" --description="Service Account for Terraform"

# obtain the organization id (org_id)
$ gcloud organizations list

# grant the Service Account roles needed to bootstrap the rest

# for working with billing accounts
$ gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding org_id \
  --member="serviceAccount:terraform@domain-infra.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/billing.admin"

# for Service Account creation
$ gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding org_id \
  --member="serviceAccount:terraform@domain-infra.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin"

# for project operations
$ gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding org_id \
  --member="serviceAccount:terraform@domain-infra.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin"

# remove default roles from the domain
$ gcloud organizations remove-iam-policy-binding org_id \
  --member=domain:domain.tld \
  --role=roles/billing.creator
$ gcloud organizations remove-iam-policy-binding org_id \
  --member=domain:domain.tld \
  --role=roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
----

== Service Account Key

Create and retrieve service account key:
[source, shell]
----
$ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create \
  /path/to/terraform-domain-infra.json \
  --iam-account=terraform@domain-infra.iam.gserviceaccount.com
----

In addition to running `pulumi` from the command line locally,
it should be possible to run it from `gradle` and from GitHub Actions.
Giving the service account key to the tool in an environment variable should enable
all the scenarios of running it.

On a local machine, we use `.envrc` file in the project repository
that `direnv` processes to set the appropriate environment variables;
see link:domain-infra/besom/.envrc[.envrc].

In GitHub Actions, environment variables are set from secrets.

== Domain Ownership

To be able to work with subdomain-like Google Storage Buckets like `state.domain.tld`,
service account `terraform@domain-infra.iam.gserviceaccount.com` has to be added to the owners of the `domain.tld` in Google Search Central at
https://www.google.com/webmasters/verification/details?hl=en&domain=domain.tld.
This is required even with the domain in Google Cloud Domains.
To be able to do this, one needs to first add the property in the
https://search.google.com/search-console[Google Search Console] - which is not a bad idea regardless,
and is also needed to later create organization, account and properties in the
https://marketingplatform.google.com[Google Marketing Platform].

Note: see also https://xebia.com/blog/how-to-automate-google-site-verification-with-terraform

== Setup

Since Pulumi setup uses Gradle, appropriate Gradle files need to be added to the project:

- `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`
- `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`
- `gradlew`
- `gradlew.bat`

Setup also requires Gradle build files for the project:

- link:domain-infra/besom/settings.gradle[settings.gradle]
- link:domain-infra/besom/build.gradle[build.gradle]

In `build.gradle`, we declare dependencies:

- Scala standard library
- Pulumi helper classes (`org.podval.tools:org.podval.tools.pulumi`) published from this repository
- Besom ('org.virtuslab:besom-core')
- Besom Google Cloud Platform provider ('org.virtuslab:besom-gcp')

Also, we need to add Pulumi project file
link:domain-infra/besom/Pulumi.yaml[Pulumi.yaml]
and stack file link:domain-infra/besom/Pulumi.dev.yaml[Pulumi.dev.yaml].

The latter specifies the Google Cloud Platform project id of the infrastructure project;
the former specifies the Google Cloud Storage bucket to use to store Pulumi state -
until the state migrates into the bucket, those lines need to be commented out.

The code is packaged as an `application` with the `tld.domain.infra.Main` as a main class:
`pulumi` command detects the presence of Gradle build file and runs
the application with `gradlew run --console=plain`.

Sample Pulumi code is in the link:domain-infra/besom/src[domain-infra/src] folder;
all of it is contained in one Scala file -
link:domain-infra/src/main/scala/tld/domain/infra/besom/Main.scala[tld/domain/infra/Main.scala].
The code uses Pulumi helper classes.

== Initialize, Import and Migrate State

Now we are ready to initialize Pulumi:
[source,shell]
----
$ pulumi login --local
$ pulumi stack init dev --secrets-provider=passphrase
$ pulumi config set gcp:project domain-infra
----

Now, we import existing resources:
[source,shell]
----
# project
$ pulumi import "gcp:organizations/project:Project" "project:domain-infra" "projects/domain-infra"

# project services
$ pulumi import "gcp:projects/service:Service" \
  "project:domain-infra/service:cloudbilling" "domain-infra/cloudbilling.googleapis.com"

$ pulumi import "gcp:projects/service:Service" \
  "project:domain-infra/service:cloudresourcemanager" "domain-infra/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com"

$ pulumi import "gcp:projects/service:Service" \
  "project:domain-infra/service:iam" "domain-infra/iam.googleapis.com"

$ pulumi import "gcp:projects/service:Service" \
  "project:domain-infra/service:serviceusage" "domain-infra/serviceusage.googleapis.com"

# service account
$ pulumi import "gcp:serviceaccount/account:Account" "serviceAccount:terraform@domain-infra" "projects/domain-infra/serviceAccounts/terraform@domain-infra.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

# service account roles
$ pulumi import "gcp:organizations/iAMMember:IAMMember" \
  "serviceAccount:terraform@domain-infra/role:billing.admin" \
  "<ORG ID> roles/billing.admin serviceAccount:terraform@domain-infra.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

$ pulumi import "gcp:organizations/iAMMember:IAMMember" \
  "serviceAccount:terraform@domain-infra/role:iam.serviceAccountAdmin" \
  "<ORG ID> roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin serviceAccount:terraform@domain-infra.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

$ pulumi import "gcp:organizations/iAMMember:IAMMember" \
  "serviceAccount:terraform@domain-infra/role:resourcemanager.organizationAdmin" \
  "<ORG ID> roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin serviceAccount:terraform@domain-infra.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
----

TODO

- project billing info
- service account keys (create new service account keys via Pulumi and delete the old ones?)

Now, the state described by the state is applied:
[source,shell]
$ pulumi up

Now that the state bucket exists, we migrate the state into it:

- export the state:
[source,shell]
$ pulumi stack export --show-secrets --file dev.stack.json

- in `Pulumi.yaml`, uncomment the state bucket configuration
- initialize and import the stack:
[source,shell]
$ pulumi stack init
$ pulumi stack import --file dev.stack.json

== Domains

TODO update

Domains can be imported from Google Domains into Cloud Domains
by the owner of the domains (not by the Terraform Service Account).
Prices in Cloud Domains are the same as in Google Domains.
Domains can be exported out of the Cloud Domains.

Once imported, domain disappears from Google Domains' list,
but is visible at `https://domains.google.com/registrar?d=domain.tld`,
and https://support.google.com/domains/answer/12299086?hl=en[can be added back] by clicking "Add Project".

Website forwarding can still be setup in the Google Domains UI even if the domain is managed by Google Cloud Domains.

Google Terraform provider https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/issues/7696[does not support Cloud Domains] -
but it does support management of the DNS records for the domains configured to use Google Cloud DNS.
For each such domain a zone must be Terraformed and then associated with the domain.
I do not see enough benefits in using Cloud DNS.

Google Domains goes away at the end of 2023, and all the domains from Cloud Domains go with it,
so I am not sure if it makes sense to move the domains from Google Domains to Cloud Domains either - but I think I'll do it just in case, and once the domains move, I'll look into the benefits of managing DNS as code again.

[source,shell]
----
$ gcloud auth login admin@domain.tld
$ gcloud domains registrations list-importable-domains
$ gcloud domains registrations import domain.tld
# assuming zones are terraformed:
$ gcloud domains registrations configure dns domain.tld \
  --cloud-dns-zone=domain-tld

# import a zone into Terraform:
$ terraform import google_dns_managed_zone.domain_tld \
  projects/domain-infra/managedZones/domain-tld

# disable DNSSEC
$ gcloud domains registrations configure dns domain.tld \
  --disable-dnssec
# switch back from Google Cloud DNF to Google Domains
$ gcloud domains registrations configure dns domain.tld \
  --use-google-domains-dns
----

== GCP Provider Upgrade - Pulumi/Besom

With Pulumi GCP provider upgrade from 6.x to 7.x,
`serviceAccount` got renamed to `serviceaccount`,
which broke my existing stacks,
and the only way I found to fix the breakage requires manual
local changes to the Pulumi state of the stack:

[source,shell]
----
# brin the stack to the local machine:
$ pulumi stack export --show-secrets --file dev.stack.json
# delete the stack and thus its state files from the state bucket
# in `Pulumi.yaml`, comment out the state bucket configuration
# tell Pulumi to place its files under `.pulumi`
$ pulumi login file://.
$ pulumi stack init dev
$ pulumi stack import --file dev.stack.json

# fix up the state file:
# - change the GCP provider version
# - fix up the `gcp:serviceAccount` to `gcp:serviceaccount`

# once `pulumi up` works again, move the state back to the bucket:
$ pulumi stack export --show-secrets --file dev.stack.json
# in `Pulumi.yaml`, uncomment the state bucket configuration
$ pulumi stack rm --force dev
$ pulumi stack init dev
# restore whatever configuration disappeared from the `Pulumi.dev.yaml` file
$ pulumi stack import --file dev.stack.json
----

== GCP Groups

https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-setup[Cloud Setup Checklist]
creates some groups that we do not need right now;
here is the record of them.

== Cloud Identity

In https://admin.google.com/ac/apps/sites/address[Admin Console]:
- activate Cloud Identity Free (optional)

References:
- https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/set-up-cloud-identity-admin[Cloud Identity]
- https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/how-to/setup[Identity Setup]

== Catch-All email

In the olden days of GSuite, it was possible to:
- add an `*@domain.tld` email alias for the user responsible for the mis-addressed messages
- configure `Apps | Google Workspace | Settings for Gmail | Routing | Catch-All`

Nowadays, the procedure is as described in
https://support.google.com/a/answer/12943537[Get misaddressed email in a catch-all mailbox].

It would be nice - but not pressing - to use groups for this.

Allegedly, there are pre-defined groups `postmaster` and `abuse`
(at least when the domain is handled by Cloud Domains/DNS).
Those groups are invisible as Workspace groups and in https://admin.google.com/ac/groups.
They are visible to the Cloud Identity API - if the service account has Group Admin Role:
[source,shell]
$ gcloud identity groups search --customer=... \
  --labels="cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.discussion_forum"
$ gcloud identity groups describe postmaster@domain.tld

Attempt to add user to such a group:

- fails in Terraform
- fails in https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/groups[Google Cloud Console] with `permission denied`
- succeeds in the https://groups.google.com[Google Groups]

I can make a group for this purpose (not `postmaster` nor `abuse`; say, `catch-all`)
and configure it as a catch-all mailbox, but I need to configure this group to accept email from outside the organization, and that requires changing a default setting for the Groups application in the Admin Console...
